# Gutenberg

## What is Gutenberg?
Gutenberg is a **real time, collaborative, multi channel, content creation system**. It's purpose is to help publication authors better manage their content.

* Real Time - Content owners can see real time live previews of their pre published content as editors continue working. 
* Collaborative - A real time user interface allows multiple content creator's to manage the same piece of content at the same time.
* Multi Channel - A single piece of content can be streamed to an infinite number of channels. See what your content looks like in each channel before publishing.
* Content Creation System - Light weight wysiwyg's, bulk image uploading/manipulation, and a user management system make Gutenberg robust but still very easy to use.

## Where can I see this live?
The application is currently reliant on a corporate authentication system and a public web demo isn't currently an option. I'm working to abstract this logic and hope to get a public demo up soon.
